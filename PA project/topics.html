            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
            <p>
                It describes a change in the average conditions — 
                such as temperature and rainfall — in a region over a long period of time.

            <h3>Carbon footprint</h3>
            <p>
                the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the 
                activities of a particular individual, organization, or community.

            <h3>Atmospheric pollutants</h3>
            <p>
               It is the presence of undesirable 
                material in the air in quantities large enough to produce harmful effects.

            <h3>Water Cycle</h3>
            <p>
                the cycle of processes by which water
                 circulates between the earth's oceans, atmosphere, 
                 and land, involving precipitation as rain and snow, drainage in streams and rivers, and return to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration.

            <p>
                a compound of hydrogen and carbon, 
                such as any of those which are the chief components of petroleum and natural gas.

            <p>
                separation of a liquid mixture into fractions 
                differing in boiling point (and hence chemical composition) by means of distillation, typically using a fractionating column.

            <h3>Polymers</h3>
            <p>
                a substance which has a molecular structure built up chiefly or completely from a large number of similar units bonded together,
                 e.g. many synthetic organic materials used as plastics and resins.

            <p>
                an organic acid containing a carboxyl group. The simplest 
                examples are methanoic (or formic) acid and ethanoic (or acetic) acid.
